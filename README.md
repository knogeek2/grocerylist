# Grocery List
by Alan Webb
First prototyped in Microsoft Access because that's what I know.
An inventory app to track what's in the house, how fast its consumed, and when it's likely to need resupply. 
Other measured facts are:
Average Qty Ordered
Average Price
Vendor
Shelf/location of item at vendor's retail establishment.
Secondary purpose is to teach myself JavaScript and JSON
